# Instructions

## Setup

### Windows

- Intel CPU
  1. Go to the [Intel developer zone system studio website](https://dynamicinstaller.intel.com/system-studio/)
  2. Search for `opencl` to find the tool `OpenCL Tools for Visual Studio`
  3. Add it to the cart and press `Continue to Download`
  4. Select `Maybe next time. Please take me to my download.` at the bottom right of the popup window
  5. Select the download button in the column `Windows* Host, Windows* Target (Plugin for Visual Studio*)`
  6. Then extract the file and run the web based installer
  7. Restart your Computer

#### GitBash/MinGW

1. Install [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install [MinGw64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download) with the options `x86_64`  and `posix` and add the directory `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin` to the user path variable (search for `enironmental variables` and double click the `Path` table entry)
3. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) and add the directory `C:\Program Files\CMake\bin` to the user path variable (search for `enironmental variables` and double click the `Path` table entry)
4. Reboot your computer

#### Visual Studio

1. Install [Visual Studio Community 2019 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview)
2. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) and add the directory `C:\Program Files\CMake\bin` to the user path variable (search for `enironmental variables` and double click the `Path` table entry)
3. Reboot your computer

##### Info

If you later decide you want to change the `x64 Debug` to `Mingw64-Debug` you need to change the `CMAKE_C_COMPILER`, `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` to the ones  in `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin` and because of some IntelliSense error in the raw JSON `CMakeSettings.json` the key `"generator": "Ninja"` and the key `"intelliSenseMode": "windows-msvc-x64"` to not get errors that `std` headers are not found.

## Run

### Windows

#### GitBash/MinGW

Open `GitBash` and run:

```sh
./build.sh
```

The files are built into the `dist` directory.

```sh
# Execute the program
cd dist
# The directory change is important to find the kernel file!
./main
```

#### Visual Studio

Open `Visual Studio` and click `File/Datei`, `Open/Ã–ffnen`, `CMake` and select the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

Then select either `x64 Debug` or `x64 Release` (much faster, like times 50) and `main.exe`.

Now click the green *Play/Run* triangle.

## Clean

Remove all temporary files

```sh
./clean.sh
```
